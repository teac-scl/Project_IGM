                                    Waters flowing in natural streams and rivers have the ability to scour channel beds,
                                    to carry particles (heavier than water) and to deposit materials, hence changing the
                                    bed topography. This phenomenon (i.e. sediment transport) is of great economical
                                    importance: e.g. to predict the risks of scouring of bridges, weirs and channel
                                    banks; to estimate the siltation of a reservoir upstream of a dam wall; to predict
                                    the possible bed form changes of rivers and estuaries. Numerous failures resulted
                                    from the inability of engineers to predict sediment motion: e.g. bridge collapse
                                    (pier foundation erosion), formation of sand bars in estuaries and navigable rivers,
                                    destruction of banks and levees.

                            are complex hydrodynamic structures under the influence of marine and river factors. In the
                            presence of large amounts of solid sediment in rivers and along coastal flows, phenomena of
                            hydromorphodynamics occur, which are associated with the formation and transformation of
                            deltas, estuaries, etc. In addition, wind waves and salt wedge effects sometimes occur.
                            Thus, the study of delta areas poses many complex problems in the processing and analysis of

                            natural processes and dynamics often change the character of the coast, the state of coastal
                            waters and biocenose. Technogenic intervention causes a chain of excitations or successive
                            gradual changes (successions) in the natural functioning of the coastal zone. The nature of
                            the causal effect of the construction on the natural processes consists in the removal of
                            the coastal part of a certain amount of matter and its gravitational movement to another
                            level, which leads to changes in the balance ratio and the mode of movement of sediments
                            that have developed in this part of the coast. Therefore, our methods of protection based on
                            natural forms protective structures (method of natural analogues) and does not affect the
                            natural processes and biocenose. Its essence lies in the fact that each of them is
                            considered as an analogue of the corresponding coastal prototype, which as a result of
                            historical development of the coastline acquired some form of time-stamp.

                            deformation on this site can be obtained on the basis of the solution of the balance of the

                            consist in managing the processes of natural development of the shore in order to transform
                            the environment and create ecological conditions that are rational for the development of

                            The erosion of soil near the banks of rivers and in their channel with a change in the
                            direction and speed of the current causes landslides and shore erosion, local pits and
                            shallows, whirlpools and backwaters, which is unfavorable for navigation and coastal
                            infrastructure. Therefore, a numerical and experimental study of the mechanism of erosion of
                            soil and its sources is actual from a scientific and practical point of view

                        <p>
                            It was found that depending on the location of the sensors of pressure fluctuations and
                            absolute pressure inside the test bench, flow regimes and conditions of the valve (open or
                            semi-closed) hydroacoustic characteristics of the jet flows are changed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The hydrodynamic noise is increased with the increase of water flow, and its maximum levels
                            are observed at frequencies (1.5-2) Hz, (2.5-3.5) Hz, (8-10) Hz and (55-75) Hz. Levels of
                            pressure fluctuations inside the bench in conditions of open valve are 1.7 times lower than
                            in conditions of semi-closed valve for water flow to 20 l/min.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The greatest mean pressure inside the bench (up to 2 kPa) is observed near the side jet for
                            glycerin solution (43%Gl+57%Water) and conditions of semi-closed valve. The lowest mean
                            pressure inside the bench is occurred near the side jet for clean water and conditions of
                            semi-closed valve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The spectral power densities of pressure fluctuations in the near wake of glycerin solution
                            jet are (1.5 ... 2) times higher than near the clean water jet in the frequency range from
                            10 Hz to 200 Hz. With the increase of kinematic viscosity of liquid the hydrodynamic noise
                            of the central and side jets is increasing, especially in the frequency range from 10 Hz to
                            100 Hz.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was found that the intensity of the pulsating hydrodynamic noise of the side jet in the
                            near wake of the semi-closed bileaflet mechanical heart valve is almost 1.5 times higher
                            than in conditions of the open valve. With the removal from the mitral valve, the pressure
                            fluctuations of hydrodynamic noise gradually decrease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was established that the maximum convective velocity of the E wave in diastole inside the
                            left ventricular model under the conditions of the open mitral valve of a small person is
                            almost 1.4 m/s, and in the conditions of the operation of the semi-closed heart valve is
                            about 3.3 m/s.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Experimental researches have shown that the valve flow noise and vibration measurements can
                            be an effective diagnostic tool of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve operation.
